This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for migrating code from 0.3.5-alpha to 0.4.0-alpha. The current version introduces several breaking changes. This document outlines the modifications, explains how to adapt your code to maintain the same behavior, and highlights updated features. In this guide we will cover two main categories of changes:
1.	**Language Features**: Changes and updates to the core language syntax and semantics.
2.	**Standard Library Updates**: Modifications to existing standard library functions and their usage.

Follow along to ensure a smooth transition to the new version. Letâ€™s get started!

# Command

The command can potentially fail. In the previous version the `unsafe` keyword was used to indicate that this command's failure should be ignored. In this release we renamed this keyword to `trust`, to better convey intent.

```ab
// Before
unsafe $ ls -a $

// After
trust $ ls -a $
```

# Iterator loop

To align with standards and improve readability, the `loop` keyword used for iterator loops has been replaced with `for`. This change ensures linguistic consistency and adopts a convention widely recognized across many programming languages.

```ab
// Before
loop number in 0..=5 {
    echo number
}

// After
for number in 0..=5 {
    echo number
}
```

# Builtin

We've introduced new builtins `len`, `exit` and `lines`, replacing their equivalents in the standard library.

## Len

To emphasize that `len` supports multiple data types, such as text and arrays, it has been moved to a builtin.

```ab
// Before
import { len } from "std/text"
echo len("Hello there!")
echo len([1, 2, 3])

// After
echo len("Hello there!")
echo len([1, 2, 3])
```

## Exit

Exit is used so often that we decided to move it as a separate built-in as well. It's implemented as a builtin statement which means that we can remove the parentheses.

```ab
// Before
import { exit } from "std/env"
exit(1)

// After
exit 1
```

## Lines

Lines was not only moved into a built-in but also it was changed in functionality. Before it accepted a `Text` value which then was splited by new line characters. In this version the newly added builtin accepts a path to file for which it returns each line.

```ab
// Before
import { lines } from "std/text"
import { file_read } from "std/fs"
lines(file_read("/path/to/file"))

// After
lines("/path/to/file")
```

> DETAILS: This built-in is specifically optimized for direct use as an iterator in a for loop. When used this way, it does not load the entire file into memory but processes it line by line, ensuring efficient resource usage.

For scenarios where lines was used on a `Text` value originating from sources other than a file, it is recommended to use the new standard library function `split_lines` instead.

```ab
// Before
import { lines } from "std/text"
lines(long_text)

// After
import { split_lines } from "std/text"
split_lines(long_text)
```


# Standard Library

In order to keep a consistent standard library function naming, most of the functions have been renamed with one exception.

## Make executable (`make_executable`)

This function has been removed in favor of `file_chmod`. The same effect can be achieved when used with `+x` flag.

```ab
// Before
import { make_executable } from "std/fs"
make_executable("script.ab")

// After
import { file_chmod } from "std/fs"
file_chmod("script.ab", "+x")
```
