We can combine our data type literals with operators. The operators only work on **the same** data type. For example adding `Text` to `Num` will cause in error and is an unsupported operation. If you want to merge multiple different values into one text, learn more here about [string interpolation](/basic_syntax/expressions#text-interpolation)

## Addition operator `+`

Addition can be performed on number, text and array. This operator applied on different data types yields different results:

- `Num` - Arithmetic sum
- `Text` - String concatenation
- `[]` - Array join

```ab
12 + 42 // 54
"Hello " + "World!" // "Hello World!"
[1, 2] + [3, 4] // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## Arithmetic operations

Arithmetic operations can only be used on `Num` data type. Here is the list of all available ones:
- `+` Arithmetic sum
- `-` Substraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division
- `%` Modulo operation

```ab
((12 + 34) * 9) % 4
```

There is also an unary operator that negates the value stored in [variable](/basic_syntax/variables).

```ab
let value = 12
echo -value // Outputs: -12
```



## Comparison operations

The equality `==` and inequality `!=` operations can be applied to any data type as long as both sides have the same type.

```ab
"foo" != "bar"
42 == 42
true != false
"equal" == "equal"
```

The remaining comparison operations can only be used on the `Num` data type. These are basically the same as in other modern programming languages: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.

```ab
42 != 24
```

## Logical operations

Logical operations can only be used on `Bool` data type. As opposed to C-like family of programming languages we've chosen to go for more Pythonic approach with literal names instead of symbols, as it suits the nature of the scripting programming language better: `and`, `or`, `not`.

```ab
18 >= 12 and not false
```

## Shorthand operator

You can use addition operator as well as any arithmetic operator combined with `=` symbol to automatically apply the result to an existing variable:

```ab
let age = 18
age += 5
echo age // Outputs: 23
```

## Text interpolation

There are moments when you want to embed values into a text:

```ab
let name = "John"
let age = 18
echo "Hi, I'm {name}. I'm {age} years old."
// Outputs: Hi, I'm John. I'm 18 years old
```
