We learned about array literals in the first chapter. In this chapter we will learn how to make use of them. Arrays are indexed from zero.

To store or retrieve a value at a particular index of an array, you can use the following syntax:

```ab
let groceries = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]
groceries[0] = "Almond"
echo groceries[1]
// Outputs: Banana
```

> WARNING: As of right now (Amber alpha) the subscript syntax does not work with expressions! This means that you can't evaluate expressions like: `foo()[0]` yet.

You can also _echo_ an entire array

```ab
echo groceries
// Outputs: Almond Banana Orange
```

To add element to an array you can use the mentioned in the [expressions chapter](/basic_syntax/expressions) addition operator to merge two arrays together.

```ab
let capitals = ["London", "Paris"]
capitals += ["Warsaw"]

let cities = capitals + ["Barcelona", "Florence"]
```

In order to see more operations on the array data type take a look at the standard library documentation which covers functions such as `join`, `len` or `sum`.

# Ranges

Amber gives you the ability to generate an array of numbers `[Num]` of certain range. There are two types of ranges:
- `..` Exclusive that are from a to b excluding b
- `..=` Inclusive that are from a to b including b

```ab
echo 0..10
// Outputs: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

echo 0..=10
// Outputs: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
