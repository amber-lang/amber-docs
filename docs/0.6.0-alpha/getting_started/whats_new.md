# Testing suite
Amber now features a built-in testing suite. It allows you to write dedicated `test` blocks that are only executed when running the `amber test` command.

We also introduced a new `std/test` library. More on that in the [Standard library improvements](#standard-library-improvements) section.

```ab
test "can multiply numbers" {
    let result = 10 * 2
    // assertions ...
}
```

You can also name your tests for better readability and filter them by name or filename using CLI arguments. Read more in the [Testing Guide](testing).

## New `std/test` module

We introduced a new [`std/test`](stdlib/doc/test) library that provides `assert` and `assert_eq` functions to help you write tests.

```ab
import { assert, assert_eq } from "std/test"

test "can multiply numbers" {
    let result = 10 * 2
    assert(result == 20)
    assert_eq(result, 20)
}
```
